# Presentation: Introduction

## Slide 1

**Text Content:**
- Introduction
- Managers, Profits, and Markets

## Slide 2

**Text Content:**
- Managerial Economics
- Managerial Economics 
Applies microeconomic theory to business problems
Uses economic analysis to make decisions for profit maximization

What is Microeconomics?
Study of consumer behavior, businesses, and markets
Helps us to understand business practices and tactics
Uses marginal analysis to provide the foundation for understanding everyday business decisions and strategy

## Slide 3

**Text Content:**
- Managerial Decision-Making
- Sample Questions that are addressed:
How many units should we produce, and at what price should we sell them?
How many employees should we hire and how should they be compensated?
Five Key Principles of Effective Management:
Identify goals and constraints
Recognize the nature and importance of profits
Understand incentives and markets
Use marginal analysis and time value of money techniques
Make data-driven decisions

## Slide 4

**Text Content:**
- 1. Identify Goals and Constraints
- Profit Maximization
Firm’s overall goal is to maximize economic profit

Constraints
Caused by scarcity
Available technology
Prices of inputs used in production
Time

## Slide 5

**Text Content:**
- 2. Recognize the Importance of Profit
- Role of Profits
Signal to resource holders of where resources are most highly valued by society

Accounting Profit
GAAP rules do not allow deduction of implicit costs (except depreciation)
		Acct Profit = Total Revenue – Explicit costs
Economic Profit
= Total Revenue – Total Economic (or Opportunity) Cost
= Total Revenue – Explicit costs – Implicit costs

## Slide 6

**Text Content:**
- Economic Cost of Resources
- Economic Cost of Using Resources
Opportunity cost (what firm owners give up to use the resource)

Categories of inputs or resources
Market-supplied resources – owned by others and hired or rented (Explicit Costs)
Owner-supplied resources – owned and used by the firm 		(Implicit Costs)
Equity Capital
Firm’s Land or Capital
Time

## Slide 7

**Text Content:**
- Economic Cost of Using Resources

## Slide 8

**Text Content:**
- Porter’s 5 Forces for Long-Run Profit

## Slide 9

**Text Content:**
- 3. Understand Incentives and Markets
- Incentives
Impact how resources and used and how hard employees work

Markets
Arrangement where buyers and sellers exchange goods / services

Market Structure
Characteristics that determine economic environment in which a firm operates
Number and size of firms in market
Degree of product differentiation and likelihood of new firms entering

## Slide 10

**Text Content:**
- Market Structure
- Price-taking firm
Cannot set price of its product
Price determined strictly by market forces of supply and demand

Price-setting firm
Has a degree of market power – ability to raise price without losing all sales

## Slide 11

**Text Content:**
- Types of Market Structures
- Perfect Competition
Large number of relatively small firms
Undifferentiated product
No barriers to entry
Price-takers with no market power
Any economic profit earned will vanish as new firms enter

## Slide 12

**Text Content:**
- Types of Market Structures
- Monopoly
Single firm
Produces product with no close substitutes
Protected by a barrier to entry
Allows the firm to raise its price without concern that economic profits will attract new competitors

## Slide 13

**Text Content:**
- Types of Market Structures
- Monopolistic Competition
Large number of relatively small firms
Differentiated products provide some degree of market power
Price-setters
No barriers to entry
Any economic profit earned will be bid away by new entrants

## Slide 14

**Text Content:**
- Types of Market Structures
- Oligopoly
Few firms produce all or most of market output
Profits are interdependent
Actions taken by one firm will affect sales and profits of the other firms

## Slide 15

**Text Content:**
- 4. Use Marginal Analysis and TVM
- Marginal Analysis Principle
To maximize net benefits, increase managerial control variable up to the point where marginal benefits = marginal costs
Examine incremental changes in revenues and costs
Time Value of Money Techniques
Often a gap exists between the time when costs are incurred and when benefits are received
Use Present Value analysis to account for timing differences

## Slide 16

![Image extracted from Slide 16](images/Introduction/slide_16_image_5.png)

**Text Content:**
- Maximize Value of the Firm
- TVM techniques help us to maximize value of the firm:


Present value of all future economic profits in each time period

Maximize Value of Firm by:
Maximizing economic profit in each period

## Slide 17

**Text Content:**
- 5. Make Data-Driven Decisions
- Understand Supply and Cost Functions
Use incremental analysis and economic analysis

Research information on Demand
Published studies, consultant, or economic modeling
Use regression analysis on quantity, price, etc.

## Slide 18

**Text Content:**
- Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Non-Profit-Maximizing Actions by Managers
Increasing output in order to lower average costs
Maximizing total revenue reduces profit
Focusing on profit margin or using cost-plus pricing will not yield profit-maximizing prices

# Presentation: Marginal Analysis

## Slide 1

**Text Content:**
- Chapter 3
- Marginal Analysis for Optimal Decision Making

## Slide 2

**Text Content:**
- Optimization
- Maximize (or minimize) an objective function (i.e., maximize profit)
Must determine level of choice variables (i.e., quantity produced) 
Constrained optimizations
Values of the choice variables are restricted (i.e., stay within budget)
Marginal analysis
Change value of choice variable by small increments for possible improvements

## Slide 3

**Text Content:**
- Net Benefit
- Decisions generate benefits & costs
Optimal decisions require an activity level (A*) that maximizes net benefit

Net Benefit (NB): difference between total benefit (TB) & total cost (TC)
NB = TB – TC
Serves as the objective function to be maximized

## Slide 4

**Text Content:**
- Optimal Level of Activity

## Slide 5

![Image extracted from Slide 5](images/Marginal Analysis/slide_5_image_393220.png)

![Image extracted from Slide 5](images/Marginal Analysis/slide_5_image_393221.png)

**Text Content:**
- Marginal Benefit & Marginal Cost
- Marginal benefit (MB)
Change in total benefit (TB) caused by an incremental change in level of the activity
- Marginal cost (MC)
Change in total cost (TC) caused by an incremental change in level of the activity

## Slide 6

**Text Content:**
- Relating Marginals to Totals
- Marginal variables measure rates of change in total variables
MB and MC measure the slopes of total benefit & total cost curves, respectively

## Slide 7

**Text Content:**
- Using Marginal Analysis to Find A*

## Slide 8

**Text Content:**
- Using Marginal Analysis to Optimize
- If MB > MC
Activity should be increased to reach highest net benefit
If MC > MB
Activity should be decreased to reach highest net benefit

Optimal level of activity
When no further increases in net benefit are possible (occurs when MB = MC)

## Slide 9

**Text Content:**
- Sunk, Fixed, & Average Costs
- Sunk costs
Previously paid & cannot be recovered
Fixed costs
Constant & must be paid no matter the level of activity
Average (or unit) costs
Computed by dividing total cost by the number of units of the activity
These costs do not affect marginal cost & are irrelevant for optimal decisions

## Slide 10

**Text Content:**
- Constrained Optimization
- Key concept: MB per $ spent
MB/P represents the additional benefit per additional $ spent on the activity
“Best buy” or “most value for your money”

When choosing among activities:
Use MB/P rather than just MB

## Slide 11

![Image extracted from Slide 11](images/Marginal Analysis/slide_11_image_411652.png)

**Text Content:**
- Constrained Optimization
- To maximize or minimize an objective function subject to a constraint
Ratios of MB/P must be equal for all activities (& the constraint must be met)

|  | of tennis sneakers in Tunisia when: |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  | 1) | Due to a supply shortage of graphite in Tunisia, |  |  |  |  |
|  |  | the price of tennis rackets increases substantially. |  |  |  |  |
