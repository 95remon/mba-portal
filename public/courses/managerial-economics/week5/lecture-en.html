    <section class='chapter'><h1>Detailed Explanation: Perfect Competition (English)</h1>
<h2>Slide 1</h2>
<p><img alt="Original Slide 1" src="extracted/images/PPTX_COM/Perfect Competition/Slide_1_Full.png" /></p>
<h3>Academic Explanation</h3>
<p>Welcome to Chapter 11, which covers <strong>Managerial Decisions in Competitive Markets</strong>. This chapter explores how managers make optimal production and pricing decisions within the framework of perfect competition, where individual firms act as price-takers.</p>
<h2>Slide 2</h2>
<p><img alt="Original Slide 2" src="extracted/images/PPTX_COM/Perfect Competition/Slide_2_Full.png" /></p>
<h3>Academic Explanation</h3>
<p>Thus far, we have developed fundamental economic tools, including optimization theory, demand forecasting, and cost analysis. Now, we integrate these tools to build a comprehensive decision framework. This framework guides managers in determining the optimal quantity to produce and the appropriate price to charge, ultimately serving the primary objective of profit maximization.</p>
<h2>Slide 3</h2>
<p><img alt="Original Slide 3" src="extracted/images/PPTX_COM/Perfect Competition/Slide_3_Full.png" /></p>
<h3>Academic Explanation</h3>
<p>A perfectly competitive market is defined by several core conditions:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Price-Taking Behavior</strong>: Firms have no influence over the market price because each produces only a negligible fraction of the total industry output.</li>
<li><strong>Homogeneous Products</strong>: All firms produce identical, standardized products.</li>
<li><strong>Free Entry and Exit</strong>: There are no barriers preventing new firms from entering or existing firms from leaving the market.
Consequently, the firm faces a <strong>perfectly elastic demand curve</strong>, which is horizontal at the equilibrium market price. For the individual competitive firm, the Demand curve is identical to both the Marginal Revenue (MR) curve and the Price (P).</li>
</ol>
<h2>Slide 4</h2>
<p><img alt="Original Slide 4" src="extracted/images/PPTX_COM/Perfect Competition/Slide_4_Full.png" /></p>
<h3>Academic Explanation</h3>
<p>This dual-panel graph illustrates the relationship between the overall market and the individual competitive firm. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Panel A (Market)</strong>: The intersection of the downward-sloping market demand curve ($D$) and the upward-sloping market supply curve ($S$) determines the equilibrium price ($P_0$) and quantity ($Q_0$).</li>
<li><strong>Panel B (Firm)</strong>: The individual firm must accept $P_0$ as a given. Therefore, the firm's demand curve is perfectly horizontal (infinitely elastic). Because the firm can sell any quantity at $P_0$ but cannot sell anything slightly above it, its Marginal Revenue ($MR$) equals the market price ($P$).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Slide 5</h2>
<p><img alt="Original Slide 5" src="extracted/images/PPTX_COM/Perfect Competition/Slide_5_Full.png" /></p>
<h3>Academic Explanation</h3>
<p>In the short run, managers face two critical decisions regarding profit maximization:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>The Shutdown Decision</strong>: Should the firm produce or shut down? If it shuts down, output is zero, variable inputs are avoided, and the economic loss exactly equals the fixed costs.</li>
<li><strong>The Output Decision</strong>: If the firm chooses to produce, what is the optimal output level? The firm must produce the exact quantity that maximizes economic profit, defined mathematically as Total Revenue minus Total Cost ($\pi = TR - TC$).</li>
</ol>
<h2>Slide 6</h2>
<p><img alt="Original Slide 6" src="extracted/images/PPTX_COM/Perfect Competition/Slide_6_Full.png" /></p>
<h3>Academic Explanation</h3>
<p>Effective profit maximization ignores the profit margin (average profit) per unit. The optimal decision must be evaluated on a <em>marginal</em> basis by comparing Marginal Benefit (MR) and Marginal Cost (MC). The output level that maximizes total profit is always higher than the output that merely maximizes the per-unit profit margin. Average profit is defined as $\pi / Q$, which simplifies to Price minus Average Total Cost ($P - ATC$).</p>
<h2>Slide 7</h2>
<p><img alt="Original Slide 7" src="extracted/images/PPTX_COM/Perfect Competition/Slide_7_Full.png" /></p>
<h3>Academic Explanation</h3>
<p>The short-run output rule dictates that a firm should produce up to the point where Marginal Revenue equals Marginal Cost ($MR = MC$). Because $MR = P$ in perfect competition, this is equivalent to $P = MC$.</p>
<ul>
<li>The firm should expand production as long as the revenue from an additional unit exceeds its cost ($MR &gt; MC$).</li>
<li>However, this rule only applies if Total Revenue covers Total Variable Costs ($TR \ge TVC$), meaning the Price must exceed Average Variable Cost ($P \ge AVC$).</li>
<li><strong>Shutdown Point</strong>: If $P &lt; AVC$, the firm minimizes losses by shutting down, incurring a loss equal to Total Fixed Costs. </li>
<li><strong>Break-Even Point</strong>: If $P = ATC$, the firm earns exactly zero economic profit.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Slide 8</h2>
<p><img alt="Original Slide 8" src="extracted/images/PPTX_COM/Perfect Competition/Slide_8_Full.png" /></p>
<h3>Academic Explanation</h3>
<p>This table demonstrates the application of the $MR = MC$ rule. At a constant price of \$35, the firm evaluates the Marginal Cost at each output level. </p>
<ul>
<li>For outputs 1 through 7, Price exceeds Marginal Cost ($P &gt; MC$), indicating the firm should increase production.</li>
<li>At an output of 8 units, $MC$ is \$30. This is the highest output where $P \ge MC$.</li>
<li>If output increases to 9, $MC$ becomes \$40, which exceeds the \$35 price. Thus, producing the 9th unit decreases total profit. Therefore, the profit-maximizing quantity is 8 units.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Slide 9</h2>
<p><img alt="Original Slide 9" src="extracted/images/PPTX_COM/Perfect Competition/Slide_9_Full.png" /></p>
<h3>Academic Explanation</h3>
<p>This table verifies the optimal decision using total aggregates instead of marginal values. Total Profit is calculated as Total Revenue minus Total Cost. At 8 units of output, Total Revenue is \$280 and Total Cost is \$199, yielding a maximum Total Profit of \$81. Producing slightly more or less than 8 units reduces this profit, confirming that 8 units is the absolute optimum. Note that at 0 output, the firm sustains a \$40 loss, representing its Fixed Costs.</p>
<h2>Slide 10</h2>
<p><img alt="Original Slide 10" src="extracted/images/PPTX_COM/Perfect Competition/Slide_10_Full.png" /></p>
<h3>Academic Explanation</h3>
<p>Graphing Total Revenue (TR) against Total Cost (TC) visually confirms the profit maximization point.</p>
<ul>
<li>The TR curve is a straight, upward-sloping line because the price is rigidly fixed at \$35.</li>
<li>The TC curve bows upward rapidly at higher quantities due to increasing marginal costs.</li>
<li>Profit is maximized at the exact output level (Q=8) where the <em>vertical distance</em> between the TR line and the TC curve is greatest. At this point, the slopes of both curves run parallel, confirming that $MR = MC$.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Slide 11</h2>
<p><img alt="Original Slide 11" src="extracted/images/PPTX_COM/Perfect Competition/Slide_11_Full.png" /></p>
<h3>Academic Explanation</h3>
<p>This standard cost graph illustrates a firm earning a positive economic profit.</p>
<ol>
<li>Output is set where the Marginal Cost ($MC$) curve intersects the horizontal Price/MR line ($Q_{profit_max}$).</li>
<li>At this specific quantity, we measure the vertical distance down to the Average Total Cost ($ATC$) curve.</li>
<li>Because the Price ($P$) is strictly greater than the $ATC$, the firm secures a positive profit margin per unit. The total economic profit is represented by the area of the shaded rectangle.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Slide 12</h2>
<p><img alt="Original Slide 12" src="extracted/images/PPTX_COM/Perfect Competition/Slide_12_Full.png" /></p>
<h3>Academic Explanation</h3>
<p>This graph illustrates a firm operating at the Break-Even Point.</p>
<ol>
<li>Output is again determined by the intersection of $MC$ and $MR$.</li>
<li>In this scenario, the market price perfectly aligns with the absolute minimum point of the bowl-shaped $ATC$ curve.</li>
<li>Since $P = ATC$ at $Q_{profit_max}$, the firm earns exactly zero economic profit. In economic terms, the firm is adequately covering all explicit and implicit costs (including a normal return on investment) but generating no surplus.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Slide 13</h2>
<p><img alt="Original Slide 13" src="extracted/images/PPTX_COM/Perfect Competition/Slide_13_Full.png" /></p>
<h3>Academic Explanation</h3>
<p>This graph depicts a firm operating at an economic loss but remaining open in the short run.</p>
<ol>
<li>The price line ($P = MR$) has fallen below the Average Total Cost ($ATC$) curve, indicating continuous unprofitability ($P &lt; ATC$).</li>
<li>However, the price line remains strictly <em>above</em> the Average Variable Cost ($AVC$) curve. </li>
<li>Because $P &gt; AVC$, the firm generates enough revenue to fully cover its variable operating costs (e.g., labor and materials) and partially contribute to paying down its fixed costs. Therefore, it is economically rational to continue operating rather than shutting down.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Slide 14</h2>
<p><img alt="Original Slide 14" src="extracted/images/PPTX_COM/Perfect Competition/Slide_14_Full.png" /></p>
<h3>Academic Explanation</h3>
<p>The Shutdown Decision is mathematically triggered when market price drops to a critical threshold.</p>
<ul>
<li>The absolute minimum of the Average Variable Cost ($AVC$) curve represents the <strong>Shutdown Point</strong>.</li>
<li>If the price is equal to or greater than the minimum of $AVC$, the firm will produce (even if at a loss).</li>
<li>If the price drops below the minimum of $AVC$, the firm will immediately cease production. At this point, revenue fails to cover even the direct variable costs of manufacturing, making any further production financially destructive. The firm's loss is then strictly equal to its fixed costs.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Slide 15</h2>
<p><img alt="Original Slide 15" src="extracted/images/PPTX_COM/Perfect Competition/Slide_15_Full.png" /></p>
<h3>Academic Explanation</h3>
<p>When making short-run production decisions, Fixed Costs (FC) are entirely irrelevant.</p>
<ul>
<li>The optimal output level is driven strictly by comparing Price ($P$) to Marginal Cost ($MC$), provided $P$ exceeds $AVC$.</li>
<li>The magnitude of Fixed Costs bears no mathematical influence on $MC$ or the minimum of $AVC$. Therefore, variations in rent or sunk infrastructural costs do not alter the firm's calculated optimal output. Only marginal dynamics dictate production volume.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Slide 16</h2>
<p><img alt="Original Slide 16" src="extracted/images/PPTX_COM/Perfect Competition/Slide_16_Full.png" /></p>
<h3>Academic Explanation</h3>
<p>To summarize the short-run decision-making process:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Whether to produce</strong>: This is determined exclusively by comparing Price against the minimum Average Variable Cost ($AVC$). If $P &lt; AVC$, the optimal decision is to shut down.</li>
<li><strong>How much to produce</strong>: Provided the firm remains operational, it will expand output until Marginal Cost equals Price ($SMC = P$).</li>
<li><strong>Amount of profit or loss</strong>: Total profit is calculated by finding the profit margin per unit ($P - ATC$) and multiplying it by the total output quantity ($Q$). Thus, $\pi = (P - ATC) \times Q$.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Slide 17</h2>
<p><img alt="Original Slide 17" src="extracted/images/PPTX_COM/Perfect Competition/Slide_17_Full.png" /></p>
<h3>Academic Explanation</h3>
<p>This dual-panel perspective integrates the macro market mechanics with the micro firm decisions.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Market (Left)</strong>: The aggregate Market Supply and Market Demand intersect to dictate the universal equilibrium price ($P$).</li>
<li><strong>Firm (Right)</strong>: The individual firm inherits this exact price, rendering its perceived demand curve ($D$) perfectly horizontal ($P = MR$). The manager traces this price line to where it intersects the firm's independent Marginal Cost ($MC$) curve to establish output ($Q_{profit_max}$). Profit is the rectangular area bounded by Price and Average Total Cost ($ATC$).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Slide 18</h2>
<p><img alt="Original Slide 18" src="extracted/images/PPTX_COM/Perfect Competition/Slide_18_Full.png" /></p>
<h3>Academic Explanation</h3>
<p>The short-run supply curve can be defined at both the firm and industry levels.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Individual Firm Supply</strong>: The portion of a competitive firm's Marginal Cost ($MC$) curve that lies strictly <em>above</em> the minimum Average Variable Cost ($AVC$) acts as its supply curve. If the price falls below minimum $AVC$, the quantity supplied immediately reverts to zero.</li>
<li><strong>Industry Supply</strong>: The overall competitive market supply curve is computed by horizontally summing all individual firms' supply curves. Because individual $MC$ curves are upward-sloping (due to diminishing marginal returns), the aggregate market supply curve is invariably upward-sloping.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Slide 19</h2>
<p><img alt="Original Slide 19" src="extracted/images/PPTX_COM/Perfect Competition/Slide_19_Full.png" /></p>
<h3>Academic Explanation</h3>
<p>Producer Surplus measures the difference between the market price received and the minimum price the producer was willing to accept (which corresponds to Marginal Cost).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Firm Level (Panel A)</strong>: It is represented graphically as the area below the market price line but above the firm's short-run marginal cost curve ($SMC$). Mathematically, it is equivalent to Total Revenue minus Total Variable Cost ($TR - TVC$).</li>
<li><strong>Industry Level (Panel B)</strong>: It is the aggregate shaded area below the market price and above the upward-sloping short-run market supply curve ($S_{SR}$). It quantifies the collective benefit reaped by suppliers due to market pricing.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Slide 20</h2>
<p><img alt="Original Slide 20" src="extracted/images/PPTX_COM/Perfect Competition/Slide_20_Full.png" /></p>
<h3>Academic Explanation</h3>
<p>In the long run, all inputs are variable, allowing firms to freely enter or exit the market. This free mobility enforces a strict equilibrium condition where all firms ultimately earn exactly zero economic profit.</p>
<ul>
<li>If short-run profits exist, new firms enter, increasing market supply and driving down the equilibrium price until profits dissipate.</li>
<li>If short-run losses exist, firms exit, decreasing market supply and driving up the price until losses are erased.</li>
<li>The terminal state of Long-Run Competitive Equilibrium occurs when Price equals both Long-Run Marginal Cost and Long-Run Average Cost ($P = LMC = LAC$).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Slide 21</h2>
<p><img alt="Original Slide 21" src="extracted/images/PPTX_COM/Perfect Competition/Slide_21_Full.png" /></p>
<h3>Academic Explanation</h3>
<p>This graph pinpoints the exact alignment of cost curves during Long-Run Competitive Equilibrium. Point $M$ represents the point of intersection where the price ($P=10$) is perfectly tangent to the lowest points of both the short-run average cost ($ATC$) and the long-run average cost ($LAC$). Concurrently, it intersects both short-run and long-run marginal costs ($SMC$ and $LMC$). Because $P = ATC$, the firm nets zero economic profit, stabilizing the industry with no incentive for future entry or exit.</p>
<h2>Slide 22</h2>
<p><img alt="Original Slide 22" src="extracted/images/PPTX_COM/Perfect Competition/Slide_22_Full.png" /></p>
<h3>Academic Explanation</h3>
<p>This sequentially tracks a market's response to an exogenous positive demand shock.</p>
<ol>
<li>Demand shifts outward from $D_0$ to $D_1$, driving the equilibrium price up to $P_1$.</li>
<li>The firm reacts in the short run by moving up its $MC$ curve, increasing output and earning temporary economic profits.</li>
<li>Over the long run, these profits act as a beacon, prompting entry by new firms. Market supply increases from $S_{0(SR)}$ to $S_{1(SR)}$.</li>
<li>This supply expansion drives the price back down to the original $P_0$. The firm's profit returns to zero, but aggregate market quantity has permanently expanded to $Q_2$.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Slide 23</h2>
<p><img alt="Original Slide 23" src="extracted/images/PPTX_COM/Perfect Competition/Slide_23_Full.png" /></p>
<h3>Academic Explanation</h3>
<p>The shape of the long-run industry supply curve is dictated by the cost dynamics of the underlying industry.</p>
<ul>
<li>It can be perfectly flat (infinitely elastic) if it is a <strong>constant cost industry</strong>.</li>
<li>It can be upward-sloping if it is an <strong>increasing cost industry</strong>.
Regardless of the trajectory of the long-run supply curve, economic profit is unequivocally zero at every point along it, reflecting long-term free-entry equilibrium.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Slide 24</h2>
<p><img alt="Original Slide 24" src="extracted/images/PPTX_COM/Perfect Competition/Slide_24_Full.png" /></p>
<h3>Academic Explanation</h3>
<p>Industry cost structures dictate the slope of the long-run supply trajectory.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Constant Cost Industry</strong>: As the industry expands and new firms enter, the prices of underlying inputs remain stable. Consequently, the minimum Long-Run Average Cost ($LAC$) does not shift, rendering the long-run supply curve completely horizontal.</li>
<li><strong>Increasing Cost Industry</strong>: As output expands, aggressive demand for specialized inputs drives input prices upward. This forces minimum $LAC$ higher, resulting in an upward-sloping long-run supply curve that requires higher prices to sustain greater output.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Slide 25</h2>
<p><img alt="Original Slide 25" src="extracted/images/PPTX_COM/Perfect Competition/Slide_25_Full.png" /></p>
<h3>Academic Explanation</h3>
<p>This graph provides a graphical derivation of a Constant Cost Industry. Despite successive demand shocks expanding market demand ($D_A \rightarrow D_B \rightarrow D_C$), the firm's minimum $LAC$ remains anchored at \$10 because input costs are stable. The market satisfies the elevated demand by absorbing new firms ($n = 200 \rightarrow 750 \rightarrow 1000$). Connecting these sequential long-run equilibrium points generates a perfectly horizontal long-run supply curve ($S_{LR}$) firmly fixed at \$10.</p>
<h2>Slide 26</h2>
<p><img alt="Original Slide 26" src="extracted/images/PPTX_COM/Perfect Competition/Slide_26_Full.png" /></p>
<h3>Academic Explanation</h3>
<p>Conversely, an Increasing Cost Industry features a rising cost floor. As market demand expands, the proliferation of firms drives up the cost of resources. Notice in Panel A that the firm's $LAC$ curve physically shifts upward ($LAC_A \rightarrow LAC_B \rightarrow LAC_C$), elevating minimum unit costs from \$10 to \$15 to \$17. To sustain equilibrium (Panel B), the market price must predictably rise to cover these heightened costs. Connecting these loci traces an upward-sloping long-run industry supply curve ($S_{LR}$).</p>
<h2>Slide 27</h2>
<p><img alt="Original Slide 27" src="extracted/images/PPTX_COM/Perfect Competition/Slide_27_Full.png" /></p>
<h3>Academic Explanation</h3>
<p>When deciding whether to hire an additional variable input—such as labor—the manager evaluates the <strong>Marginal Revenue Product ($MRP$)</strong>. </p>
<ul>
<li>$MRP$ measures the additional revenue generated by employing one more unit of the input. It is calculated by multiplying the Marginal Product of the input ($MP$) by the market price of the output ($P$).</li>
<li>The firm maximizes profit by hiring inputs exactly up to the point where $MRP$ equals the input's price or wage ($w$).</li>
<li>Notably, employing inputs to the point where $MRP = \text{input price}$ guarantees identical profit-maximizing results to the standard production rule where Marginal Cost equals Price ($MC = P$).</li>
</ul>
<h2>Slide 28</h2>
<p><img alt="Original Slide 28" src="extracted/images/PPTX_COM/Perfect Competition/Slide_28_Full.png" /></p>
<h3>Academic Explanation</h3>
<p>The decision to cease operations and lay off the workforce involves the <strong>Average Revenue Product ($ARP$)</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>$ARP$ represents the average revenue generated per unit of input (e.g., Total Revenue divided by Total Labor).</li>
<li>If the $ARP$ falls below the market wage ($w$) at all possible levels of employment, hiring is structurally unprofitable.</li>
<li>In this scenario, Total Revenue strictly trails Total Variable Cost ($TR &lt; TVC$), satisfying the classic shutdown condition. The optimal decision is to dismiss the workforce entirely.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Slide 29</h2>
<p><img alt="Original Slide 29" src="extracted/images/PPTX_COM/Perfect Competition/Slide_29_Full.png" /></p>
<h3>Academic Explanation</h3>
<p>This graph consolidates the firm's input hiring optimization.</p>
<ul>
<li>The firm's optimal hiring locus follows the $MRP$ curve (the blue line), but only along the segment that lies strictly below the peak of the $ARP$ curve.</li>
<li>If the market wage is remarkably high at $w_0$, it barely grazes the peak of $ARP$. The firm hires only $L_0$ workers, earning zero operating profit and teetering on the edge of shutdown.</li>
<li>If the wage drops to $w_1$ or $w_2$, the firm expands hiring to $L_1$ and $L_2$ respectively, guided by the $MRP$ intersection. Because these equilibrium points rest below the $ARP$ curve, the firm successfully captures a positive short-run operating margin.</li>
