Production in the Long Run
In the long run, all inputs are variable
Isoquants
used to study long-run production decisions
Role of Manager
Produce output on production function by aligning incentives to induce maximum worker effort
Use the right mix of inputs (labor and capital) to maximize profit
--- Slide 3 ---
Production Isoquants
Isoquant
Curve showing all possible input combinations capable of producing a given level of output
Downward sloping
: if more labor is used, less capital is required to produce a given output
--- Slide 4 ---
Marginal Rate of Technical Substitution
MRTS
Measures rate at which two inputs can be substituted for one another while maintaining a constant level of output
Slope of an isoquant
--- Slide 5 ---
Marginal Rate of Technical Substitution
MRTS
can also be expressed as the ratio of the two marginal products:
--- Slide 6 ---
Isocost Curves
Show combinations of inputs that may be purchased for a given cost
Input prices fixed at w (labor) and r (capital) for each
isocost
(C =
wL
+
rK
)
Changes in
isocosts
For given input prices,
isocosts
farther from the origin are associated with higher costs
Changes in input prices change the slopes of
isocost
lines

Optimal Input Combination
Cost is minimized for Q* where isoquant is tangent to
isocost
Optimal combination of inputs for Q*
Implies MP per $ spent on last unit of each input is the same

Optimal Input Combination to Minimize Cost
--- Slide 10 ---
Optimization &amp; Cost
Expansion path
Provides efficient (least-cost) input combinations for every level of output
Derived for a specific set of input prices
Along expansion path, input-price ratio is constant &amp; equal to the
MRTS

Expansion Path

Returns to Scale
If inputs are increased, by how much will output increase?
Increasing returns to scale
– output goes up by more than increase in inputs
Decreasing returns to scale
– output goes up by less than increase in inputs
Constant returns to scale
– same increase
--- Slide 13 ---
Long-Run Average Cost
Long-run average cost
(LAC)
Measures cost per unit of output when optimal amount of each input is used
LAC
is
U-shaped
Falling
LAC
indicates
economies of scale
Rising
LAC
indicates
diseconomies of scale
--- Slide 14 ---
Long-Run Marginal Cost
Long-run marginal cost
(LMC)
Measures rate of change in LR total cost as output changes along expansion path
LMC
is
U-shaped
LMC
lies below
LAC
when
LAC
is falling
LMC
lies above
LAC
when
LAC
is rising
LMC = LAC
at the minimum value of
LAC

Economies of Scale
Economies of Scale
Declining portion of the LAC as output increases
Diseconomies of scale
Rising portion of the LAC as output increases

Various Shapes of LAC

Economies of Scope
Economies of Scope
Exist when joint cost of producing two or more goods is less than the sum of the separate costs of producing the goods
For two goods,
X
&amp;
Y
, economies of scope exist when:
C(X, Y) &lt; C(X) + C(Y)

Relations Between SR and LR Costs
Tangency
At each output where an ATC is tangent to LAC, the relevant
