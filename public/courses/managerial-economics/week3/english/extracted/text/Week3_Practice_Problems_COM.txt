	Answer the following questions:												
	1) 	What is Total Cost at 5 units?						1	10				
		What is ATC at 5 units?						2	18				
								3	30				
	2)	What is Marginal Cost at 5 units?						4	45				
								5	65				
	3)	How much is ATC at its minimum value?											
		How much output does that amount correspond to?											
								Output	Variable Costs		Fixed Cost	Total Cost	Marginal Cost
	1)	TC = VC + FC									20	20	
		At 5 units, VC = $65 and FC = $20. 						1	10		20	30	10
		So, TC = $65 + $20 =		85				2	18		20	38	8
		ATC = TC / Q = 		17				3	30		20	50	12
								4	45		20	65	15
								5	65		20	85	20
	2)	MC = change in TC / change in Q											
		At 5 units, MC = ($85 - $65) / (5-4) =				20							
	3)	Minimum ATC =		16.25									
		Occurs at	4	units

		second unit of capital add to total output? 										
	1)	Go down column for 1 unit of capital										
		150 units - 110 units =		40	units							
	2)	Go down 1st column and calculate MP for each worker										
		At what point does the next worker yield less than the prior worker?										
		1st worker --> +50 units		3rd	unit of labor							
		2nd worker --> +60 units										
		3rd worker --> +40 units										
	3)	Use 4th column, at 2nd worker output is 390.										
		AP = output / # workers										
		AP = 390 / 2		AP =	195	units						
	4)	Go across 3rd row										
		360 units - 150 units =		210	units

	4)	How much is MC at its minimum value?				
	1)	Min AVC occurs at Max AP				
				450	workers	
		AP = Q / L, so Q = AP x L and thus Q = 2025 x 450				
				Q =	911250	units
	2)	AVC = w / AP				
				AVC =	0.493827160493827	per unit
	3)	Min MC occurs at Max MP				
				300	workers	
		Q = AP x L = 1800 x 300				
				Q =	540000	units
	4)	MC = w / MP = $1000 / 2700				
				MC =	0.37037037037037	per unit

	Answer the following questions:						
	1) 	What is the price of labor (w)?					
	2)	What combination of labor (L) and capital (K) can					
		produce 5,000 units of output at lowest cost?					
	3)	What is the lowest possible cost of producing 					
		5,000 units of output?					
	4)	What is the lowest possible cost at which 					
		14,000 units of output can be produced?

						The price of capital (r) is $20.			
	Answer the following questions:								
	1) 	What is the price of labor (w)?							
	2)	What combination of labor (L) and capital (K) can							
		produce 5,000 units of output at lowest cost?							
	3)	What is the lowest possible cost of producing 							
		5,000 units of output?							
	4)	What is the lowest possible cost at which 							
		14,000 units of output can be produced?							
	5)	At the optimal combination of inputs for producing 							
		14,000 units of output, what is the MRTS?							
	1)	Determine amount along an isocost and divide by units of labor to get cost of labor.							
		At endpoint of first isocost, units of capital is 90 and price of capital is $20.							
		Thus, first isocost value is (90 x $20) or				1800			
		At labor endpoint, units of labor are				60			
		Cost of labor = $1800 / 60 =				30	per unit		
	2)	Lowest cost point will be tangency to isocost.							
		Coordinates for point of tangency are				60	units of capital		
						20	units of labor		
	3)	Tangency point lies on isocost which was already 							
		determined to be 		1800					
	4)	Lowest cost point will be tangency to isocost.							
		Tangency point lies on isocost which has same cost throughout.							
		At endpoint, isocost = (180 x $20) =				3600			
	5)	MRTS is the slope of the isocost (absolute value)							
		Slope = MPL / MPK = w / r = ($30 / $20) =				1.5
