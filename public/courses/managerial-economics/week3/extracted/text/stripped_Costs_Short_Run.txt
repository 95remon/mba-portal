Chapter 8
Production &amp; Cost in the Short Run
--- Slide 2 ---
Production Theory
Production function
Shows maximum potential output from a given set of inputs and existing technology
Technical efficiency
Achieved when maximum output is produced with a given set of inputs
Economic efficiency
Achieved when firm produces a given output at the lowest possible total cost
--- Slide 3 ---
Inputs
Variable input
Level of usage may be changed readily
Fixed input
Level of usage
cannot
readily be changed
Must be paid even if no output produced
Quasi-fixed input
Input used in fixed amount (“lumpy”) for any positive level of output but not paid if output is zero
--- Slide 4 ---
Production Theory
Short run
At least one input is fixed
All changes in output achieved by usage changes of variable inputs
Long run
All inputs are variable
Output changed by varying usage of all inputs
--- Slide 5 ---
Short Run Production
In the
short
run,
capital is fixed
Only changes in the variable
labor
input can change the level of output
Average product of labor
AP = Q/L
Marginal product of labor
MP =
Q/L

Marginal product
-additional output that will be forthcoming from an additional worker, other inputs constant
Average product
- output per worker
Shows output resulting from combinations of factors or inputs

Average &amp; Marginal Products
Relationship between
AP
and
MP
:
When
AP
is rising,
MP
&gt;
AP
When
AP
is falling,
MP
&lt;
AP
When
AP
reaches maximum,
AP = MP
Law of diminishing marginal product
At some point while increasing the usage of a variable input, its marginal product
decreases

Short Run Production Costs
Total variable cost
(TVC)
Increases as output increases
Total fixed cost
(TFC)
Does
not
vary with output
Total cost
(TC)
TC = TVC + TFC

Short Run Cost Curve Relations
AFC
decreases as output increases
Equals distance between
ATC
&amp;
AVC
AVC
and
ATC
are
U
-shaped
AVC
approaches
ATC
as
Q
increases
SMC
is
U
-shaped
Intersects
AVC
&amp;
ATC
at minimum points
SMC
is below
AVC
&amp;
ATC
when they are falling, and above when they are rising
--- Slide 18 ---
AVC
MC
Q
Costs per unit
ATC
The marginal cost curve goes through the minimum point of both the ATC and AVC curves

Short-Run Production &amp; Cost Relations
When
MP
increases,
SMC
decreases
Same holds for
AP
and

When
MP
decreases,
SMC
increases
Same holds for
